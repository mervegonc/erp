# Multi-Company ERP System

This project is a **Multi-Company ERP System** designed to allow multiple companies to manage their internal operations independently, while also enabling users to create profiles and apply for job listings across various companies.

### Key Features:
1. **User Profile Management**:
   - Users can sign up, create detailed profiles including education, certifications, and work experience, and update their profiles as needed.
   - Profiles serve as a central hub for job applications, making the system intuitive for both job seekers and companies.

2. **Multi-Company Support**:
   - Each company operates within its own isolated schema, allowing for separate and secure data management.
   - Companies can manage their own departments, positions, employees, and roles within these isolated schemas.

3. **Job Listings & Applications**:
   - Companies can post job listings for available positions, and users can apply to those listings.
   - Applications are centrally managed in the main schema, but the details and roles are isolated within each company's schema.

4. **Role Management**:
   - A flexible role-based system is implemented within each company's schema to assign roles such as admin, manager, and employee to its users.
   - Employees within companies have specific roles that govern access and permissions within the system.

5. **JWT-Based Authentication**:
   - Secure authentication is provided via JWT tokens, ensuring that users and companies can log in safely and manage their data.
   - The system integrates a robust security layer to safeguard sensitive information.

### Scalability & Flexibility:
- The system is designed to scale with the needs of both users and companies. Each companyâ€™s data is isolated, ensuring privacy and security, while still maintaining the flexibility to integrate new features and enhancements as needed.
  
This ERP system provides a comprehensive solution for managing job applications, employee data, and internal company structures, all while maintaining the scalability and flexibility required by modern businesses.
